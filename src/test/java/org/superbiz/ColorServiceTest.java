/**
 * Arquillian will start the container, deploy all @Deployment bundles, then run all the @Test methods.
 *
 * A strong value-add for Arquillian is that the test is abstracted from the server.
 * It is possible to rerun the same test against multiple adapters or server configurations.
 *
 * A second value-add is it is possible to build WebArchives that are slim and trim and therefore
 * isolate the functionality being tested.  This also makes it easier to swap out one implementation
 * of a class for another allowing for easy mocking.
